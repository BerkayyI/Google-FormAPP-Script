1. Error Checking ( Errors have been such as what would happen if the time is 00:00 and if the  Start time is higher than End time)

2. Send an Email has been added as an function for the Admin which allows him to send an email to the .... number of people selected by him.

3. Calendar overlapping has been fixed ( The future where user can decide to remove the previous Calendar isn't added )

4. The code still takes the calendar id in the code because I couldn't find a way to fix the problem even tho I tried lots of things.


Information:
  - In short the script right now works pretty much alright. There might be some bugs which I am not aware of. But the main stuff are working such as sending an Email to the user if the reservation is accepted or if we encountered any errors with the users reservation. Creates an Calendar where the users information and reservation time/details are in. The script also allows the Admin to choose how many people he wants to send the email to.
